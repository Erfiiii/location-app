# Geo JSON App

A simple Location app for getting `geoJson` features of a location.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run Frontend in Development Mode:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

   The page will reload if you make edits, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.


3. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   ```

### Implementation Decisions

I chose to use `React.js`, `Typescript`, `React-Leaflet` for showing map and `osmtogeojson` for fast development.
